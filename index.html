If you were scanned recently, and are not running a bug bounty program, sorry. I'm a bug bounty participant and security researcher. As part of this I may include a IP range that is out of scope. Please blacklist your IPs on the below Gist to exclude your IPs from any scans. 

Blacklist IPs Gist: https://gist.github.com/notoriousturtle/c179c97141c348fc32c5159dd5b26a78

Any scans I perform are not malicious in nature, and are expected to have no negative impacts. My scans are in line with typical usage (e.g. check if a HTTP server exists). Examples of scans I may perform are:
- Scanning the internet for port 80
- Sending a GET request to a specific endpoint to identify a particular instance of software

To further this example, if I detect a particular peice of software and the address falls within a organisation that includes the endpoint as part of their bug bounty program, I may investigate further.
